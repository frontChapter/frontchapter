Building a product is not just about features or technology — it’s about how buyers actually experience and value it. Too often, we design from an inside-out perspective, forgetting that the *real product* lives in the minds of our customers.  

When teams focus only on adding features, they risk creating overflow: more complexity, more friction, and less clarity. Instead, the goal should be to refine, simplify, and make sure that every improvement directly connects to real buyer needs.  

True improvements don’t always come from more. They often come from **less but better** — reducing noise, improving usability, and aligning the product with the context in which people use it.

  Facing a challenge in life is kind of a turn-on for an easy rider. When life gives you lemons, use them in your designs.

This mindset shift allows teams to:  
- Identify the real pain points buyers face.  
- Eliminate unnecessary features that add confusion.  
- Focus energy on experiences that create long-term value.  

In the end, success is not about what we build, but about what buyers can *achieve* with it. Overflow slows them down; clarity and thoughtful design move them forward.
